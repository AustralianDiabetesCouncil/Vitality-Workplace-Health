		<h2 class="section-title">Why take the survey</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Those who have or are at risk of diabetes (and other chronic diseases) often are not aware of any symptoms or early warning signs. The Vitality Health and Wellbeing Survey offers you the ideal opportunity to "get in early and take meaningful action" to reduce your risk and if you already have been diagnosed, to better manage your condition.</li>
			<li>Acting sooner rather than later, with small easy lifestyle changes can transform the way your health plays out throughout your life.</li>

							<p>The survey was very useful as I realised I wasn't drinking enough water and had to up veges and fruit. It has sparked behaviour change.

							<p>The survey was helpful. I liked the diabetes risk score - really useful. The instant feedback was valuable. It showed that I was eating quite well but possibly not moving enough which did kick-start more exercise for me. It was helpful to take time out of the day to think about this stuff. I am now eating better and am doing a lot more exercise. I would like to re-do it, particularly to measure my waist again.

							<p>The survey was useful in providing information about my health. I came into the high risk category. I was surprised at this but I know why now. The summary was really nice. It is good to know what I am doing well. The pages with the health tips were helpful; not too long - really good.
